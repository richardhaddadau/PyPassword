# PyPassword
Password generator with Python

I needed a good password generator.

Brief:
- Spits out multiple passwords in one hit
- Every password generated must score well on https://password.kaspersky.com
  (seemed the most strict in the few security sites I checked)  
- Generated passwords can't begin with a number or symbol
- Generated passwords can't have two numbers, two symbols or a number and symbol together
